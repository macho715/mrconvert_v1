## Semantic KPI Layer

### Storage Operations KPIs

- **Storage Utilization Rate**: Percentage of available vs. used storage space (target: 70-85%)
- **Preservation Compliance Rate**: Adherence to temperature/humidity guidelines (Hitachi: â¥95%)
- **Heavy Transport Lead Time**: DOT permit approval to delivery time (SLA: â¤7 days)
- **Laydown Availability**: Site laydown readiness vs. construction schedule (â¥95% availability)

## Recommended Commands

`/storage-plan optimize --site=MIR` [Site laydown optimization for MIR facility]
`/preservation check --material=Hitachi` [Preservation compliance verification for Hitachi equipment]
`/inland-transport permit --weight=120t` [DOT permit application for heavy cargo transport]
`/laydown-capacity query --site=DAS` [Available laydown capacity at DAS site]

It confirms that a pre-sailaway inspection was conducted, and the vessel was found fit for
the voyage.
Usage:
This certificate serves as official approval from the Marine Warranty Surveyor for the
transportation of the cargo by sea. It is used to ensure compliance with safety standards
and operational procedures for the voyage, providing assurance to stakeholders, insurers,
and relevant authorities.

## Semantic KPI Layer

### Integrated KPIs

- **Cargo Safety Index**: Stability compliance rate across all phases (target: â¥95%)
- **Lashing Efficiency**: Capacity vs. usage in marine transport (target: â¥85%)
- **Deck Utilization**: Area exploitation in MOSB/vessels (target: 70-85%)
- **Handling Incident Rate**: Zero target in lifting/stowage operations
- **Preservation Adherence**: Temp/RH compliance for bulk items (target: 100%)
- **Voyage Optimization**: Actual vs. planned times with stability factors (target: â¥90%)

## Recommended Commands

`/bulk-cargo plan --stowage=lct` [Bulk cargo stowage planning for LCT operations]
`/lashing-calc validate --safety-factor=1.2` [Lashing assembly calculation and safety factor validation]
`/stability-check evaluate --gm=0.5` [Vessel stability evaluation with GM/VCG/roll angle analysis]
`/lifting-plan optimize --method=Skidding` [Lifting plan optimization with rigging gear selection]
`/cargo-traceability track --cargo=cgo-001` [End-to-end cargo traceability from port to site]

## Original Content

This integrated ontology document combines:

1. **Material Handling Workshop content** from `HVDC_Material Handling Workshop_(20241119_1).pdf` (6 sections covering Overview, Customs, Storage, Offshore Transport, Site Receiving, and Transformer handling)

2. **Bulk Cargo Operations ontology** from `1_CORE-05-hvdc-bulk-cargo-ops.md` (detailed stowage, lashing, stability, and lifting operations)

### Integration Benefits

- **Unified Knowledge Graph**: Single ontology namespace (`hvdc:`) for all material handling and bulk cargo operations
- **End-to-End Traceability**: Track cargo from port arrival through storage, transport, and installation
- **Automated Validation**: SHACL constraints ensure safety and compliance across all operations
- **Predictive Analytics**: Integrated KPIs support decision-making and risk management
- **Compliance Enforcement**: UAE customs, ADNOC HSE, IMSBC, SOLAS standards embedded in constraints

This consolidated approach enables comprehensive logistics management for the HVDC project, supporting both operational execution and strategic planning.
