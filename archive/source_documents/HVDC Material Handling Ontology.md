Executive Summary
The Material Handling Workshop provides a comprehensive perspective on logistics operations for the Independent Subsea HVDC System Project (Project Lightning) in the UAE. It emphasizes timely overseas and inland transportation of purchased materials, with a focus on customs clearance, port handling, storage, and site offloading. Key entities include ports (Khalifa for containers, Zayed for bulk/heavy cargo, Jebel Ali for special cases), the Mussafah Offshore Supply Base (MOSB) as a central hub, and onshore/offshore sites (MIR, SHU, DAS, AGI). Operations are divided into stages: A (overseas importation) and B (offshore marine transportation via LCT). Compliance with UAE customs regulations, ADNOC HSE standards, and supplier-specific preservation requirements (e.g., Hitachi) is critical.

How it Works (Flow)

Overseas Import (Phase A): Materials arrive at ports → Customs clearance → Port handling → Inland transport to MOSB/Sites.
Offshore Transport (Phase B): Consolidation at MOSB → Loading onto LCT → Marine voyage to islands → Offloading.
Site Receiving: Inspection (MRI/MRR) → Storage/Preservation per classification → Issuance (MRS/MIS).
Transformer Handling: Unloading → Temporary storage → On-foundation via SPMT/Skidding → Preservation checks.


Section 2: Customs Clearance
Source

Original File: HVDC_Material Handling Workshop_(20241119_1).pdf (Pages 7-9)
Version: unified-1.0
Date: 2024-11-19

Executive Summary
Customs clearance complies with UAE regulations using eDAS system for document submission. Required documents include BL/AWB, Commercial Invoice, Packing List, Certificate of Origin, and Attestation Invoice. Consignee is Abu Dhabi Offshore Power Transmission Company Limited LLC, with ADNOC/ADOPT codes. For Dubai imports (e.g., Jebel Ali), duty is paid by contractor and reimbursed. Status is shared with ADOPT post-clearance.

Section 3: Storage & Inland Transportation
Source

Original File: HVDC_Material Handling Workshop_(20241119_1).pdf (Pages 10-14)
Version: unified-1.0
Date: 2024-11-19

Executive Summary
Storage follows Material Management Control Procedure, with classifications (Annex J) and supplier guidelines (e.g., Hitachi: Indoor +5° to +40°C, RH ≤85%). Indoor warehouses near MIR/SHU (6,000-8,000 sqm) for sensitive materials. Laydowns at sites: MIR (35,006 sqm), SHU (10,556 sqm), DAS (35,840 sqm), AGI (47,198 sqm). Inland transport for heavy equipment (>90t) requires DOT permit. Process includes unloading, storage on stools/beams, and preservation.

Executive Summary
This integrated ontology combines the material handling processes from the HVDC workshop with the bulk cargo operations ontology, creating a unified knowledge graph for the Independent Subsea HVDC System Project (Project Lightning) in the UAE. It encompasses overseas importation (Phase A), offshore marine transportation (Phase B), and detailed bulk cargo handling, including planning, loading, discharging, stowage, lashing, stability control, and lifting. Key entities include ports, MOSB hub, sites, cargo types (e.g., transformers, steel structures, OOG), and transport means (e.g., LCT, SPMT). Compliance with UAE customs, ADNOC HSE, IMSBC, SOLAS, and supplier preservation standards (e.g., Hitachi) is enforced. The integration aligns classes and relations to support end-to-end traceability, automation, and risk management for bulk and project cargo.

How it Works (Flow)

Overseas Import (Phase A): Materials arrive at ports → Customs clearance → Port handling → Inland transport to MOSB/Sites.
Offshore Transport (Phase B): Consolidation at MOSB → Loading onto LCT (planning, stowage, lashing) → Marine voyage (stability control) → Offloading (lifting, discharging).
Site Receiving: Inspection (MRI/MRR) → Storage/Preservation per classification → Issuance (MRS/MIS).
Bulk Cargo Integration: Data collection → Draft plans (loading, lashing, stability) → Execution (QC checks) → Post-operation (surveys, reports).
Transformer Handling: Unloading → Temporary storage → On-foundation via SPMT/Skidding → Preservation checks, aligned with bulk lashing/stability.


Section 2: Customs Clearance
Source

Material Handling: HVDC_Material Handling Workshop_(20241119_1).pdf (Pages 7-9)
Integration Note: Aligns with bulk cargo documentation requirements (e.g., BL for stowage planning).

Executive Summary
Customs clearance adheres to UAE regulations via the eDAS system, requiring documents such as BL/AWB, Commercial Invoice, Packing List, Certificate of Origin, and Attestation Invoice. The consignee is Abu Dhabi Offshore Power Transmission Company Limited LLC, utilizing ADNOC/ADOPT codes. For Dubai imports, duties are paid by the contractor and reimbursed. Post-clearance status is shared with ADOPT. Integration with bulk cargo ensures document links to stowage and lashing plans.

Section 3: Storage & Inland Transportation
Source

Material Handling: HVDC_Material Handling Workshop_(20241119_1).pdf (Pages 10-14)
Integration Note: Incorporates bulk cargo storage constraints (e.g., stackable, hazmatClass).

Executive Summary
Storage complies with Material Management Control Procedure, classifications (Annex J), and supplier guidelines (e.g., Hitachi: Indoor +5° to +40°C, RH ≤85%). Indoor warehouses near MIR/SHU (6,000-8,000 sqm) handle sensitive materials. Site laydowns: MIR (35,006 sqm), SHU (10,556 sqm), DAS (35,840 sqm), AGI (47,198 sqm). Inland transport for heavy items (>90t) requires DOT permits. Integration adds bulk attributes like COG and stackability for storage optimization.

How it Works (Flow)

Storage Classification: Assign per Annex J/Hitachi; consider bulk COG/stackable.
Locations: Designate indoor/outdoor yards, ports, MOSB.
Heavy Transport: Unload vessel → Temp storage → Barge/Inland → Site offload.
Permits: DOT for >90t, police approval.

Bulk Cargo: 1_CORE-05-hvdc-bulk-cargo-ops.md
Integration Note: Merges with bulk loading/discharging, lashing, and stability.

Executive Summary
Operated by ADNOC L&S at MOSB, adhering to Offshore HSE, IMSBC, and SOLAS. Process: Gate pass → Planning/docs → Operation (LOLO/RORO) → Exit pass. Voyage times: MOSB-DAS (20 hrs), MOSB-AGI (10 hrs). Integration incorporates bulk elements: stowage/lashing assemblies, stability cases, and environmental factors for seafastening and control.

Operation: Request equipment, lashing; calculate tension/safety factors.
Shipping: Priority plan, PL to islands; stability checks (GM/VCG).
Voyage: LCT transport, safety priority; monitor environment (wind/seaState).

Material Handling: HVDC_Material Handling Workshop_(20241119_1).pdf (Pages 19-29)
Integration Note: Links to bulk post-operation surveys and handovers.

Executive Summary
Adheres to Material Management Control Procedure. Includes delivery planning, HSE (PTW, FRA), receiving (MRR/MRI/ITP/MAR), OSD for discrepancies, requests/issuances (MRS/MIS), storage/preservation, and forms. Integration adds bulk survey reports and handover documents.

Section 6: Material Handling (Transformer)
Source

Material Handling: HVDC_Material Handling Workshop_(20241119_1).pdf (Pages 30-42)
Integration Note: Aligns with bulk lifting plans and rigging gear.

Executive Summary
Transformer schedules detail ETD/ETA/port/on-site dates. On-shore: Unload → Storage → Inland (DOT permit). Off-shore: SPMT loading → LCT roll-on → Sea fastening. Preparations: PTWs, risk assessments, stability/mooring plans. Receiving: Survey, compaction, jackdown. Preservation: Impact recorder, gas top-up. On-foundation: Skidding. Integration adds bulk lifting/rigging details.
